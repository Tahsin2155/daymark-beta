**DayMark** is a simple, intentional habit and journaling tool designed to help you
stay consistent, reflect daily, and understand your progress over time.

### 🎯 Why DayMark?
Many habit trackers focus only on streaks. DayMark focuses on:
- **Daily awareness**
- **Reflection over perfection**
- **Long-term consistency**

### 🧠 What you can do
- Track habits monthly with a clean grid
- Journal daily with guided reflection prompts
- Visualize your consistency and trends
- Keep everything private and personal

### 🔐 Data philosophy
Your data belongs to you. DayMark stores only what is necessary to provide the service,
and your journal entries are never shared or analyzed beyond your own analytics.

Built with care using Streamlit and Firebase.
